MongoDB is a document database that is designed to be simple to develop and scale with the needs of modern applications. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that is available on a variety of platforms and offers high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB is built around the concepts of collection and document storage.        ",
