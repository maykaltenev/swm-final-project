      "explanation": "JavaScript is not a pure OOP's (object oriented programming) based languages such as PHP, java or many other languages, although it is an object-based language. It is not OOP's based language, because it doesn't have three basic properties of object-oriented programming languages, such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance.",
